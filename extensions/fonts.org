#+TITLE: Extensions: fonts

** Load fonts from common locations

If ~$DISPLAY~ is set, the ~fonts~ extension will load fonts from common
locations.

Currently the locations are:

| Directory                | Recursive |
|--------------------------+-----------|
| ~/.fonts                 | no        |
| ~/.local/share/fonts     | no        |
| /usr/local/share/fonts/* | yes       |
