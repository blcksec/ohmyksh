* openbsd

This extension adds a number of useful OpenBSD specific tools.

The following functions are added:

| Name           | Purpose                                                                                             |
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cdw()          | Intended to be used from a port directory. Will change directory to ~$WRKSRC~.                      |
| maintains()    | Similar to ~port()~, this will display the ~$MAINTAINER~ of a port passed in as the first argument. |
| pclean()       | Remove ~.orig~ and empty files from ~$CWD~.                                                         |
| revert_diffs() | Recursively move .orig files to their corresponding file name.                                      |
| port()         | Like ~src()~, but for ~/usr/ports~.                                                                 |
| port_grep()    | Recursively search ports tree for [file]'s that contain [pattern].                                  |
| seq()          | A shell implementation of Linux's [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/seq][seq(1)]] command. It supports alpha and numeric ranges.             |
| src()          | Similar to plan9's [[http://man.9front.org/1/src][src(1)]] command. It drops you to ~/usr/src/*/<arg 1>~.                            |
