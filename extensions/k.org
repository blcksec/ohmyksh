#+TITLE: Extension: k

~k~ is a function that allows one to quickly jump to directories based off
simple pattern matching.

** Usage

*** Jumping to known locations

#+begin_src shell
  qbit@tal[0]:~$ k ohmy
  qbit@tal[0]:~/src/ohmyksh got:(master)$ k wip
  qbit@tal[0]:/usr/ports/openbsd-wip got:(master) git:(master)$ 
#+end_src

*** Storing locations for later jumping

#+begin_src shell
  cd ~/directory/with/long/name
  k
#+end_src

 After running ~k~, the current directory will be stored in ~~/.k~.

 From this point on, you can reach the directory from anywhere by running ~k
 long name~.

*** Removing locations from jump list

#+begin_src shell
  k long name
  k rm
#+end_src

*** Listing jumpable directories

#+begin_src shell
  k ls
#+end_src

*** Sorting / removing duplicates

#+begin_src shell
  k clean
#+end_src
