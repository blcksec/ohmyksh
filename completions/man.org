#+TITLE: Completions: man

** Leven 1

Completions for man pages are found via:

#+begin_src shell
	MANPATH=/usr/share/man man -k Nm~. | cut -d\( -f1 | tr -d , | \
		sort | \
		uniq > $MAN_CACH
#+end_src

Currently the cache is never re-created. Operating without a cache causes
significant load times. If one requires the cache to be refreshed they can run
the following in ~.xsession~ or similar:

#+begin_src shell
rm -f ${LOAD_PATH}/cache/man
#+end_src
