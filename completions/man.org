#+TITLE: Completions: man

** Leven 1

Completions for man pages are found via:

#+begin_src shell
ls /usr/{share,X11R6,local}/man/man[1-9] | sort -u > $MAN_CACHE
#+end_src

Currently the cache is never re-created. Operating without a cache causes
significant load times. If one requires the cache to be refreshed they can run
the following in ~.xsession~ or similar:

#+begin_src shell
rm -f ${LOAD_PATH}/cache/man
#+end_src
