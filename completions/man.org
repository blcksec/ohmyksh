#+TITLE: Completions: man

** Leven 1

Completions for man pages are found via:

#+begin_src shell
for i in /usr{,/X11R6,/local}{,/share}/man/{,cat,man}[1-9lnp]{,f,p}
do
	test -d $i && ls $i
done | rev | cut -d. -f2- | rev | sort -u > $MAN_CACHE
#+end_src

Currently the cache is never re-created. Operating without a cache causes
significant load times. If one requires the cache to be refreshed they can run
the following in ~.xsession~ or similar:

#+begin_src shell
rm -f ${LOAD_PATH}/cache/man
#+end_src
