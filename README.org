** About
Have your cake and eat it too!

~ohmyksh~ is a framework for expanding OpenBSD's [[https://man.openbsd.org/ksh][ksh]]. It offers:

- completions :: for common things like [[https://man.openbsd.org/man][man]] pages, [[https://man.openbsd.org/ssh][ssh]] ~known_hosts~ and ~git~ (and
  ~got~!) commands. 
- extensions :: to import bulk functionality, including git-prompt, OpenBSD
  specific tooling, disabling color.. etc. 
- prompts :: a decent selection of useful, minimal prompts.

#+begin_src shell
  # ohmyksh needs to know where it lives, so we tell it via this env var:
  OHMYKSH_DIR=${HOME}/src/ohmyksh

  # Now we can load everything up!
  . ${OHMYKSH_DIR}/ohmy.ksh

  # All the paths we use (in order!)
  set -A my_paths -- \
          /usr/ports/infrastructure/bin \
          ~/bin \
          ~/go/bin \
          /usr/local/plan9/bin

  paths "${my_paths[@]}"

  # Load our various extensions
  load_extension fonts
  load_extension k
  load_extension nocolor
  load_extension openbsd

  # Load handy completions for various things
  load_completion ssh
  load_completion vmd
  load_completion rc
  load_completion gopass
  load_completion git

  alias vi=vim
